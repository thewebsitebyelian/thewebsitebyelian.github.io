	<p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and release wildlife back into their natural environment. 
	We are a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>

     into their natural environment.</p>
    
	<p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care for our animals.
